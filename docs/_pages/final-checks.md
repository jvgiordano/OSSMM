# OSSMM System Verification

THIS IS A WIP

You've assembled the OSSMM system! Now let's verify that it works as intended:

## Procedure

Requisites:
1. Android Device with OSSMM App
2. OSSMM Headband
3. Both devices are charged

To verify your OSSMM system:

1. Turn on the OSSMM headband byu pressing the ON/RESET button on the front face.
2. Put on the OSSMM headband.
3. Open the OSSMM app on your Android device.
4. Enable the BLE and Location requirements.
5. Go to Settings >> Find Device.
6. Connect the the OSSMM device.
7. Move to the Live Data section
8. Move your head and confirm the Accelerometer and Gyroscope plots show your movement.
9. Quickly move your eyes left-to-right, right-to-left, or in circles to verify your eye movement is detected.
10. View the Heart Rate plot to see that your pulse is being detected.


Advanced Verification - if interested in sleep modulation:

(After following the steps above)

11. Go to "Sleep Modulation" and enable
12. Press Test Modulation during the connection
   - The OSSMM headband should vibrate in a double "blinky" pattern (On-Off...On-Off)
