# OSSMM System Verification

THIS IS A WIP

You've assembled the OSSMM system! Now let's verify that it works as intended:

## Procedure

Requisites:
1. Android Device with OSSMM App
2. OSSMM Headband
3. Both devices are fully charged
4. 

Verify your OSSMM system:

1. Open the OSSMM app on your Android Device.
2. Turn on Bluetooth if not already done so.
3. Put on the OSSMM headband.
4. Turn on the OSSMM headband by pressing the ON/RESET button.
   - The front BLUE LED should blink. Wait for it to finish.
5. Return to the app and press "Select Device and Start Recording".
6. Select the OSSMM headband - "OSSMM".
7. Once connected the "View Current Data" button will become available. Press it.
8. Move your head and verify the acceleromter and actigraphy measurement functions.
9. Quickly look left and right to verify the EOG measurement functioning.
10. Check the Pulse graph to determine if the pulse measurement functions.
11. Return to the main screen. Press "Disconnect and Stop Recording".
   - This will end the connection and turn off the OSSMM headband
   
Note: The only way to turn off the OSSMM headband is through the app. 

Advanced Verification - if interested in sleep modulation:

1. Follow steps 1-4 above.
2. Enable the toggle "Sleep Modulation"
3. Follow steps 5-8 (i.e., verify you connected to the OSSMM headband)
4. Return to the main screen. Press "Test Modulation"
   - The OSSMM headband should vibrate in a blinky pattern (On-Off...On-Off)
