Now it's time for the final assembly! You should have before you the three major components for the OSSMM headband:

*1. The strap*
*2. The electronics case*
*3. The receiver*

Before we can assemble these components, we need to modify the heart-rate monitor
strap. Since it's designed to fit around the chest, it's too long for use as a 
headband and must be shortened. Then will connect the components together easily!

The modular design of the OSSMM system offers important benefits for future use. 
If any issues arise with the OSSMM headband, thse principal components can be
quickly replaced rather than the entire system being changed. For example, the
strap can be removed for washing or replaced entirely if needed.

Now let's combine the major components and create an OSSMM headband!

# Prepare the Strap

## Important Note on Strap Selection!

Not all heart-rate monitor straps on the market are equivalent. Importantly, the
conductance of the silicone electrodes varies significantly between brands. This
can affect the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the EOG/EEG signals.

To clarify what this means in practical terms: SNR describes how easily the 
electrodes transmit the signals we are looking for compared to unwanted 
electrical noise. The lower the electrode resistance (i.e., the higher the 
conductance), the better the SNR will be. Better SNR means clearer signals, 
which leads to more accurate data capture and sleep staging by the OSSMM system.


Unfortunately, it is difficult to know these conductance (or resistance values) 
without the manufacturer's data sheet. Polar Care has provided these details for
their Polar Pro Strap, specifying a surface resistance of 500 立.


You can measure an approximate surface resistance of your strap's electrodes 
using a quality multimeter on the resistance measurement setting:

*1. Set the multimeter to resistance measurement mode (2k立 setting if applicable)*
*2. Place probes at a fixed distance on one silicone electrode*
*3. Apply sufficient pressure for good contact*
*4. Record the reading*

This reading will give you an idea of how conductive your heart-rate monitor 
strap is. Please be aware, however, that accurate measurements require 
specialized equipment! It is recommended where possible to find heart-rate 
monitor straps with the lowest resistance. 

Technical validation for sleep staging found that even electrodes with an 
approximate surface resistance of 620 立 were adequate for EEG signature 
detection with machine learning classifiers. We have found that some brands 
produce straps with electrodes with resistance levels as low as 135 立.


Although we believe that most straps on the market should provide sufficient 
conductivity, it is not possible to confirm this for every possible option. 
Therefore, we recommend testing the straps in advance if you do not have the
relevant data sheet.
