Provided here are the Data and Safety Sheets for
the components used in the OSSMM device. Because
storage size is a restrictive factor for this 
repository, some of the data sheets have been 
compressed. The manufacturer and component names
have been provided for all, therefore it is
possible to retrieve uncompressed copies elsewhere
online should they be required.

Regarding the heart rate monitor strap, the OSSMM
design functions with the industry standard dimensions
of the electrode contact width which is ~46 mm. Each
manufacturer produces these straps with varying
materials and different quality levels of conductive
material. Provided in this documentation is the data
sheet for the Polar Care Pro Strap, and an email
from a company representative showing the supplier
requirements which cover a range of safety standards.
To be explicit, other straps may be used, but the 
Polar Care Strap Pro information is presented as a 
viable option.
